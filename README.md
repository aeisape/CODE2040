CODE2040
========
This was a pretty fun challenge overall. I started trying to complete this challenge in c++,
but with json being new to me and the process being rather complicated, I switched to python.
I believe this was the best option for me, as I know C, C++ and python, python is the only one
with default functionality (and simple functionality at that) for all the tasks. Though C or C++
may have been much faster, python was the best choice for me in implementation because of all of
the built-in libraries.

JSON
=======
Json was the main challenge for me as I had never worked with it before, in addition to the fact that
internet connection speeds for me when not at school are VERY slow, causing timeout errors, which I
initially thought were due to errors in the code rather than with my connection speed. Once I figured 
out the actual issue, it was a simple matter of stopping everyone in the house from watching netflix and 
playing xbox while I ran my code. All tests passed and my code even gave me a little pat in the back.

Challenges
===========
The first task was not so bad, as both C++ and python have either very simple implementations or something
in the STLs to accomplish the task.
The second and third tasks were a bit harder initially because I wanted to keep the time complexity around o(logN). I ended up not doing this, as the length of the arrays did not warrant the the extra proccessing and added time 
complexity of sorting the array prior. They were reasonably small and the increase in speed would most
likely not have been very significant or consequencial.
The last task was simple once i discovered the libraries that accomplished the desired goals. i combined the two
libraries with the simplest implementations and it worked like a charm because of the fact that they both took in
and returned data of the exact same format.
